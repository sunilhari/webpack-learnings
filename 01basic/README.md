# Webpack Basic 01

<pre>
npm install
</pre>

This would install `webpack`,`webpack-cli` and `webpack-bundle-analyzer`

Demo would simply run a simple module in development and production mode.
<pre>
npm run develop
</pre>

<pre>
npm run build
</pre>
![production output](https://github.com/sunilhari/webpack-learnings/blob/master/01basic/support/production.PNG)


Bundle analyzer plugin is attached to webpack here to understand what the bundle size is constituted off.
