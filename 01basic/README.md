# Webpack Basic 01

<pre>
npm install
</pre>

This would install `webpack`,`webpack-cli` and `webpack-bundle-analyzer`

Demo would simply run a simple module in development and production mode.
<pre>
npm run develop
</pre>
![develop output](./support/develop.png)

<pre>
npm run build
</pre>
![production output](./support/production.png)


Bundle analyzer plugin is attached to webpack here to understand what the bundle size is constituted off.
